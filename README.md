# CAO MINH KHOI - PI.EXCHANGE INTERVIEW

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Live demo here: https://gify-angular15.vercel.app

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
    I have spent 3 to 4 hours each day within a week to make this project happen.
    If I have more time, I would make the loading of gifs smoother and add some features like gif videos, and stickers, and make the code cleaner and more robust.
    And I would also make the UI more beautiful and user friendly and of course, more unit test cases.

    Thanks for reviewing my project, hope to hear feedback from you soon.
